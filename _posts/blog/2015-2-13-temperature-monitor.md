So, after taking its time travelling the eastern oceans, my [RTL2832U based DVB dongle][dvbdongle] finally arrived this week! Check [the previous post]({% post_url /blog/2014-12-22-sdr-dongle-ordered %}) for some background on what I have in mind for it ;)

Had partial success picking up the energy monitors sensor values, but managed to have quite some fun the RF temperature sensors I've been using for years!

Here's a nice shot of a little page I've put up, showing the temperature history at my balcony:
